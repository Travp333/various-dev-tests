stuff I think needs work, or needs to be implemented, or whatever. just a to do list basically. THis list will likely just keep getting bigger and bigger

IDEA: keep the mall as a pizza slice inside of blender, then recreate the 6 sided symmetry inside unity. 

make animations to transition from idle rto running/ springitng, might help with skiing and just feel better overall

the wall at the end of wings doesnt trigger on steep on the side facing the inside of the mall

give julia a gun aiming state, right click to aim, left click to shoot, shift while aiming to melee?

think about how Julia could carry physics objects. Gravity gun? hold over her head? rope grappled on?

finish inventory system and implement it here

third person character capsule collider doesnt match when swimming 

make first person swimming animations 

some windows normals are flipped

swallowed Holl Teleporters neeed some work, NPCs cant tp through them and sometimes the player will clip through the wall behind them when using it repeatedly

NPC animation controller needs work, blend spaces set up but can still be finicky

the NPCs get confused around balconies and edges of high places

the gibs system for breaking props can be optimized a bit too to handle mass breaking better. maybe check to see how many gibs there currently are spawned already then set a cap to how many can be rendered at once. then the shatter script can vary how many gibs it spawns depending on that

need to make a "landing" animation

make responding to gravity shifts work in first person too. check the UpdateRotation script

consider a switch to cinemachine for the camera?

make wall climbing jumps contextual. climbing idle jump-> jump is perpendicular to wall, climbing left jump -> jump along wall to the left, etc

fall damage

little skid when you rapidly change directions?

interactable NPC's. Speaking, roaming, fighting, etc.

let me ragdoll any NPC and myself

platform that dissapears when you jump on it 

Make an ice area of the level

make a variety of different types of doors 

make conveyor belts or doors or whatever dependent on a battery, very dishonored styled

MAKE SOME LEVELS

sometimes i just have to change sphere physics material from minimum to multiply and idk why it just like changes sometimes idk

figure out how to make a material togglable transparent (Poyomi may make this easier!)
